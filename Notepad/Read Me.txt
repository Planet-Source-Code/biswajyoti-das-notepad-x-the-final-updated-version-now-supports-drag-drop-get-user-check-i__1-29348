Hi friends, this is an updated version of notepadx .. and probably the 
last version of the project that I hold close to my heat ... which I claimed
to be the most closest clone to MIcrosoft(R) Notepad .. and now I can proudly
say .. this is the best clone for Notepad ... 

Features: 

* Word Wrap (Font also changes as we swap ... a bug left in the first version)
* Select Font (Pressing Cancel won't matter .. a bug left in the first version)
* Write .LOG at the top of your file and when you reopen the file you will see 
  the difference at the bottom of the file ( a feature that exists in Notepad ) ...
  pointed to me by John. Thanks friend. I have also included a file with .LOG for 
  you to check out the feature ....
* Drag DRop Files
* Get user and Organization Name in About form.
* Information about Total and Available Physical Memory in About Form.

I hope you will like this and please vote for me ...

Thanks for downloading my code .. I hope you enjoy this code as much as I 
enjoyed programming it.
